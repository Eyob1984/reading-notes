 ### What makes an interface useful?
  * Interfaces are useful because they provide contracts that objects can use to work together without needing to know anything else about     each other. The point of interfaces is not to help you remember what method to implement, it is here to define a contract.[sourcelink](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/108240/why-are-interfaces-useful)
 ### Why is middleware called middleware?
 * Because it is working as a "middleman" between two application and make the process smooth.
  
 ### Fundamentally, what does it mean to have a mock of something? Why is this useful?
 * A mock means a non-real copy of something. The use of mock is we can do something like a test without hurting or affecting the actual or   origin thing.

 ### What does it mean to have a mock database?
 * Mocking is primarily used in unit testing. An object under test may have dependencies on other (complex) objects. To isolate the behavior   of the object you want to replace the other objects by mocks that simulate the behavior of the real objects. This is useful if the real     objects are impractical to incorporate into the unit test.
  In short, mocking is creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. [sourcelink]      (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2665812/what-is-mocking)
