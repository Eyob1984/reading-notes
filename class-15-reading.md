#### What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?

* A leaf Node is a Node without any subsequent edges / connections.

#### Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order?

    * PreOrder traversal - visit the parent first and then left and right children;
    
    * InOrder traversal - visit the left child, then the parent and the right child;
    
    * PostOrder traversal - visit left child, then the right child and then the parent;

#### What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?

* The height is log(n) in a balanced tree.

#### How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?

* Stacks and queues are used when you are traversing a tree.
