                        ** Class- 32- Redux Async Action**
                       
 ### Async Actions
 
  * When you call an asynchronous API, there are two crucial moments in time: the moment you start the call, and the moment when you receive an answer (or a timeout).
 
 
 
 ### What is Redux thunk?
 
  * Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the storeâ€™s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the body of the function once the asynchronous operations have completed.
