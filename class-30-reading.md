### What are Graphs in DSA

  * A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.
  
  * The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.
  
    *  `Vertex` Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. 
    
    * `Edge` Edge represents a path between two verices or a line between two vertices.
    
    * `Adjacency`  Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.
    
    * `Path` Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices.
