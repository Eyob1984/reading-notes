 ### React Native
 
  * React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.
  
 ### What is the difference between React Native and react?

  * React Native compiles to native app components, which makes it possible for you to build native mobile applications. In React JS, React is the base abstraction of React DOM       for the web platform, while with React Native, React is still the base abstraction but of React Native.
