                        ** Class-11-reading-DSA: Stacks and Queues**
#### Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a stack.
* String Reversa Stack is used to reverse a string. We push the characters of string one by one into stack and then pop character from stack.
#### Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a queue.
* Bank line where people who come first will done his transaction first.
#### Why are pop, push, enqueue and dequeue always O(1)?
* This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes `(n)` you have in the stack.
#### Why do stacks and queues not have traversal or searching operations?
* Because stacks use FILO or LIFO, and queues use FIFO or LILO, so there is no need to use traversal or searching operations.
