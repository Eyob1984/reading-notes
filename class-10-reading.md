#### Why is authentication important?
* Authentication is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users (or processes) to access its protected resources, which may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services

#### Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?
* password is one of the key compenont for the user to log into their account.

#### What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
* I think encryption and Hash Algorithm takes a piece of data and produces a hash that is deliberately difficult to decode. If identical data is passed into the algorithm, the same hash will always be produced.

#### What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
*  Encoding is for maintaining data usability and can be reversed by employing the same algorithm that encoded the content, i.e. no key is used. Encryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires the use of a key (kept secret) in order to return to plaintext.

#### What is a token used for?
* A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created
