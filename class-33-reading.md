 ### Redux Toolkit
 
  * The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux: 
  
    1. "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
    
    2. "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
    
    3. "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
