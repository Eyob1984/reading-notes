### What is a data structure?
* A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
### How is a Linked List different from an array?
* Elements are stored consecutively in arrays whereas it is stored randomly in Linked lists. One of the main diffrence is an array in the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements whereas the Linked list is considered as non-primitive data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.

### What is one benefit a Linked List has over an array?
* The benefit of linked over an array is the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements whereas the Linked list is considered as non-primitive data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.


### What data does a Node hold in a doubly Linked List?
* The link to the previous node, an integer value, and the link to the next node. 

### What would you use to implement a Linked List data type? (object, function, class, variableâ€¦?)
