#### Why is access control important? Describe an application that would need access control.

* The goal of access control is to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the system. Example 

#### What is a role used for?

* Role-based access control (RBAC), also known as role-based security, is a mechanism that restricts system access. It involves setting permissions and privileges to enable access to authorized users. Most large organizations use role-based access control to provide their employees with varying levels of access based on their roles and responsibilities. This protects sensitive data and ensures employees can only access information and perform actions they need to do their jobs.

#### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

* In case of discretionary acces control whoever owns the data decides which specific users can access it but role based access control use each user has an assigned role, and that role determines what they have access to.
