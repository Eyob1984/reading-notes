                        ** Class-28 - Context API**

#### What is the difference between the variables MyContext and MyProvider in the examples above?

* `Muprovide` is the calss that created the state variables and the context object `MyContext`. Sharing the state variable thourgh out the components is done by `myContext`.

#### Why is context useful?

* Context is most helpful with state variables, but thereâ€™s no restriction on what the `value` property on a provider is set to. So you can even hard code values to create static global variables.

#### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
