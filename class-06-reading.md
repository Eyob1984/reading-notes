### What does protocol mean?
* A protocol is a standard set of rules that allow electronic devices to communicate with each other.
### How does any web browser understand how to open any webpage?
* When you open your web browser and type in a web address (URL) for a web page, the browser submits a request to the server
### Name one thing a request object must have, and one thing a response object must have
* A Request also has two built-in attachments, authorization and path. authorization contains authorization information from an Authorizer and path has request path information from a Router.
* An Response has a status code, headers and body
### What is the difference between HTTP and REST?
* HTTP is a communications protocol that transports messages over a network. SOAP is a protocol to exchange XML-based messages that can use HTTP to transport those messages. Rest is a protocol to exchange any(XML or JSON) messages that can use HTTP to transport those messages.
### Why is REST important?
* REST supports many data formats, but the predominant use of JSON means better support for browser clients.
